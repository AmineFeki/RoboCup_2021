# RoboCup_2021
In this repository, my team and I have developed a code of a line-follower robot for RoboCup 2021 competition. With this code, we have won the 2nd place.

First thing to know is that all the process is managed by a state machine that is described in the (.pdf) file uploaded here. I think that it is well explained, but in case you have any question you can contact me via mail.

Secondly,  to ensure a full control on the speed and the position of the robot, we have used Roboclaw [https://www.basicmicro.com/Roboclaw-2x7A-Motor-Controller_p_55.html]
PS: For your knowledge, it is recommended to know more about regulation and PID controls, so you will be aware of the importance of such boards.
